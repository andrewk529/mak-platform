## Reporting a Vulnerability

### 🚨 Critical - Security Vulnerabilities

**DO NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### Reporting Channels

**Primary:** Email security issues to **andrewk529@protonmail.com**

**Subject Line Format:** `[SECURITY] Brief description`

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

1. **Vulnerability Type**
   - Smart contract vulnerability
   - Frontend/backend security issue
   - Authentication/authorization bypass
   - Data exposure
   - Other (specify)

2. **Severity Assessment** (your opinion)
   - Critical (immediate threat to user funds/data)
   - High (significant security risk)
   - Medium (limited impact)
   - Low (minimal risk)

3. **Detailed Description**
   - Clear explanation of the vulnerability
   - Affected components/contracts
   - Potential impact and attack scenarios

4. **Reproduction Steps**
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce

### Example Report

```markdown
Subject: [SECURITY] Reentrancy vulnerability in PropertyMarketplace

**Vulnerability Type:** Smart Contract Vulnerability

**Severity:** Critical

**Description:**
The PropertyMarketplace.purchaseShares() function is vulnerable to 
reentrancy attacks. An attacker can drain funds by recursively calling 
the function before state updates complete.

**Affected Component:**
- Contract: PropertyMarketplace.sol
- Function: purchaseShares()
- Lines: 145-160

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Deploy malicious contract with fallback function
2. Call purchaseShares() with malicious contract
3. Fallback function calls purchaseShares() again
4. Repeat until target funds are drained

**Proof of Concept:**
[Attach PoC code or link to private repository]

**Impact:**
- Complete drainage of marketplace funds
- Loss of user assets
- Platform reputation damage

**Suggested Fix:**
Implement ReentrancyGuard from OpenZeppelin and follow 
checks-effects-interactions pattern:

```solidity
function purchaseShares(uint256 listingId, uint256 shares) 
    external 
    payable 
    nonReentrant {
    // Checks
    require(shares > 0, "Invalid shares");
    
    // Effects
    listing.shares -= shares;
    
    // Interactions
    propertyToken.safeTransferFrom(seller, buyer, propertyId, shares);
    payable(seller).transfer(payment);
}
```
```

## Response Timeline

We take all security reports seriously and aim to:

- **Acknowledge receipt:** Within 24 hours
- **Initial assessment:** Within 48 hours
- **Regular updates:** Every 3-5 days
- **Resolution timeline:** Depends on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 3-7 days
  - Medium: 1-2 weeks
  - Low: 2-4 weeks

### Our Process

1. **Triage:** Assess severity and impact
2. **Investigation:** Reproduce and analyze vulnerability
3. **Patch Development:** Create and test fix
4. **Security Review:** Internal audit of fix
5. **Deployment:** Deploy patch to production
6. **Disclosure:** Coordinate public disclosure (if applicable)
7. **Recognition:** Credit reporter (with permission)

## Security Measures

### Infrastructure Security

#### Smart Contract Security

- Prevents single point of failure
- Time-delayed execution for major changes

✅ **Access Control**
- Role-based permissions (OpenZeppelin AccessControl)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular permission audits

✅ **Upgrade Mechanisms**
- Transparent proxy pattern for upgradability
- Time-locked upgrades with community notification
- Emergency pause functionality

✅ **Circuit Breakers**
- Emergency pause in case of security incidents
- Gradual unpause mechanisms
- Protected by multi-sig

#### Frontend/Backend Security

✅ **Authentication & Authorization**
- Secure wallet connection (WalletConnect, MetaMask)
- JWT token-based API authentication
- Rate limiting on all endpoints

✅ **Data Protection**
- HTTPS/TLS encryption for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection (Content Security Policy)

✅ **API Security**
- API key rotation
- Request signing
- Rate limiting and throttling
- DDoS protection

#### Infrastructure

✅ **Monitoring & Alerts**
- 24/7 system monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Real-time security alerts
- Automated incident response

✅ **Backup & Recovery**
- Regular automated backups
- Disaster recovery plan
- Geographic redundancy

## Smart Contract Security

### Security Audits

**Audit Schedule:**
- Pre-launch: Full security audit by reputable firm
- Quarterly: Ongoing security reviews
- Before major updates: Comprehensive audit

**Past Audits:**
- Q1 2025: Initial audit (scheduled)
- Audit reports published at: `docs/audits/`

### Security Practices

```solidity
// ✅ Good Security Practices

// 1. Reentrancy Protection
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract SecureMarketplace is ReentrancyGuard {
    function purchaseShares() external nonReentrant {
        // Protected against reentrancy
    }
}

// 2. Access Control
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

contract SecureProperty is AccessControl {
    bytes32 public constant ADMIN_ROLE = keccak256("ADMIN_ROLE");
    
    function sensitiveOperation() external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
        // Only admins can execute
    }
}

// 3. SafeMath (Solidity 0.8+ built-in)
function calculate(uint256 a, uint256 b) external pure returns (uint256) {
    return a + b; // Automatic overflow protection
}

// 4. Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern
function withdraw() external {
    uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender]; // Check
    balances[msg.sender] = 0;              // Effect
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);  // Interaction
}

// 5. Input Validation
function setPrice(uint256 price) external {
    require(price > 0, "Price must be positive");
    require(price <= MAX_PRICE, "Price exceeds maximum");
    propertyPrice = price;
}
```

### Known Vulnerabilities We Prevent

| Vulnerability | Prevention Method |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Reentrancy | ReentrancyGuard, CEI pattern |
| Integer Overflow | Solidity 0.8+ or SafeMath |
| Access Control | OpenZeppelin AccessControl |
| Front-running | Commit-reveal schemes |
| Timestamp Manipulation | Block.timestamp only for long periods |
| DoS with Revert | Pull payment pattern |
| Tx.origin Authentication | Always use msg.sender |

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Wallet Security

✅ **Protect Your Private Keys**
- Never share your private keys or seed phrases
- Use hardware wallets for large holdings
- Enable all available security features (2FA, biometrics)

✅ **Verify Transactions**
- Always review transaction details before signing
- Check recipient addresses carefully
- Verify contract addresses match official ones

✅ **Stay Informed**
- Follow official MAK Platform channels
- Be aware of phishing attempts
- Verify URLs (official: makplatform.com)

❌ **Red Flags - Potential Scams**
- Unsolicited messages requesting private keys
- "Too good to be true" investment promises
- Urgent requests to take action immediately
- Unofficial websites or apps

### For Developers

#### Secure Development

```typescript
// ✅ Secure Coding Examples

// 1. Input Validation
function validatePropertyId(id: number): boolean {
  if (!Number.isInteger(id) || id < 0) {
    throw new Error('Invalid property ID');
  }
  return true;
}

// 2. Error Handling
async function fetchProperty(id: number) {
  try {
    validatePropertyId(id);
    const property = await contract.getProperty(id);
    return property;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to fetch property', { id, error });
    throw new Error('Property fetch failed');
  }
}

// 3. Safe External Calls
async function callExternalContract(address: string) {
  if (!ethers.utils.isAddress(address)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid address');
  }
  // Proceed with call
}

// 4. Rate Limiting
const rateLimiter = new RateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per window
});
```

#### Environment Security

```bash
# ✅ Secure .env practices

# Never commit sensitive data
# Use different keys for dev/staging/prod
# Rotate keys regularly

# .env.example (safe to commit)
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=sepolia
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111

# .env (never commit - in .gitignore)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_actual_private_key_here
INFURA_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```
