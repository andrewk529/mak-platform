## General Questions

### What is MAK Platform?

MAK Platform is a blockchain-powered real estate investment platform that enables fractional property ownership through tokenization. It allows investors to buy shares of premium real estate starting from as little as $100, earn rental income, and trade shares 24/7 on a decentralized marketplace.

### How does fractional ownership work?

Each property is tokenized into shares using ERC-1155 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. When you purchase shares, you own a percentage of the property and receive:
- Proportional rental income (distributed monthly)
- Proportional capital appreciation (when property is sold)
- Voting rights on property decisions

### Who is behind MAK Platform?

MAK Platform is founded by a triple-licensed real estate professional with:
- Real Estate Broker License
- DMV Professional License
- Insurance Professional License
- 15+ years of traditional real estate experience

### Is this legal?

Yes. MAK Platform operates under proper licensing and complies with all applicable real estate and securities regulations. Property tokens are treated as securities and follow SEC regulations (Reg D or Reg CF).

## For Investors

### How much do I need to start investing?

You can start with as little as $100 worth of cryptocurrency (ETH). This makes premium real estate investment accessible to everyone.

### What returns can I expect?

Returns come from two sources:
1. **Rental Income**: Typically 4-8% annual yield, distributed monthly
2. **Property Appreciation**: Historical real estate appreciation of 3-5% annually

**Example**: A $10,000 investment could generate:
- Rental income: $400-$800/year
- Appreciation: $300-$500/year
- **Total**: $700-$1,300/year (7-13% total return)

*Past performance does not guarantee future results.*

### How do I receive rental income?

Rental income is automatically distributed to your crypto wallet monthly through smart contracts. You can:
